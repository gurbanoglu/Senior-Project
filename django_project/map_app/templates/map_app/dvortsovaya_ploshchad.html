			Similar to the Red Square in Moscow, the Palace Square
			has been <br> a location which has witnessed events
			throughout history that <br> have had a profound effect
			on Russian society. The name in Russian, <br> "Dvortsovaya
			Ploshchad" translates to palace square because <br>
			"Dvortsovaya" can be interpreted as "pertaining to a
			palace", <br> and "ploshchad" as square. Today, military
			parades, sporting <br> events, and concerts are held in
			the square. Individuals dressed <br> up as characters
			from the Tsarist era can be seen standing next <br> to
			vintage horse carriages offering tourists a ride.
			Surrounding <br> the square lies the Winter Palace facing
			the General Staff Building, <br> a museum on the opposite
			side. In the center stands the soaring <br> Alexander
			Column to commemorate Russia's victory against the
			<br> strategic invasion of French Emperor Napoleon
			Bonaparte in 1812.

			In spite of the magesticity of the site, the square
			has beared <br> the brunt of dark days in Russian
			history. This is where an <br> unsuccessful
			assassination attempt against Tsar Alexander II <br>
			took place on April 2nd, 1879. Twenty-six years later,
			royal	<br> guards would open fire on weaponless
			demonstrators killing over <br> a hundred civilians
			and paving the path for the first Russian	<br>
			Revolution of 1905. <br> <br> On October 25th, 1917,
			Bolshevik paramilitary forces gathered in	<br> the
			square and successfully went on to sack the Winter
			Palace <br> bringing an end to hundreds of years of
			Tsarist rule in Russia. <br><br> One of the organizers
			of the sacking was Moisei Uritsky who would <br>
			eventually be assassinated on August 30th, 1918 near
			the entrace <br> to the General Staff Building. Thus,
			from 1918 to 1944 the Palace <br> Square was was
			referred to as "Uritsky Square" as a sign of respect
			<br> to the organizer.
