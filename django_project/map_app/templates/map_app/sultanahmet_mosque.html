        <p>  Frequently referred to as the "Blue Mosque", the Sultanahmet
        <br> Mosque, received its name from its greatest comissioner: Sultan
        <br> Ahmet I. It was ordered to be built in 1609, during the time
        <br> that the Ottomans were enduring a crushing loss in their war 
        <br> with Persia. Historians see this as a decision motivated by
        <br> reaffirming Ottoman influence. 
        <br>
        <br> Built on what once was a palace for Byzantine Emporers, the mosque
        <br> faces the Hagia Sophia, a structure constructed during Byzantine 
        <br> rule. Gazing upon the Sultanahmet mosque, it may be hard to believe
        <br> that its completion took only seven years from 1609-1616. Presently,
        <br> the land that the mosque sits on what is known as the Sultanahmet 
        <br> Square.</p>

        <p>  The mosque is composed of two different architectural styles:
        <br> traditional Islamic architecture and Byzantine architecture.
        <br> Venturing into the mosque, one can spot twenty-thousand Iznik
        <br> tiles consisting of sixty distinct tulip patterns absorbing
        <br> the sunlight through the 260 stained glass windows. Six minarets
        <br> tower the city of Ä°stanbul at a noticeable 210 feet. Each minaret
        <br> contains two or three balconies where a man called the "muezzin"
        <br> makes the Islamic call to prayer five times every day.
        <br> 
        <br> The roof of the Sultanahmet mosque is made up of one central dome
        <br> positioned 141 feet above ground, bordered by four other domes, as 
        <br> well as eight lower-level domes.</p>
