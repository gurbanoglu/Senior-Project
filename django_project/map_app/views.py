SearchMap()

NAME

    SearchMap - handles the HttpRequest to the 'search-map/' address.

SYNOPSIS

    def SearchMap(request):
        request        --> the HttpRequest object which Django uses to pass
        state through the system.

DESCRIPTION

    This function will either accept a POST request or a GET request. Upon a
    POST request, the view will grab the data that was submitted along with
    the "MapDataForm". If it is valid, the view will save it, and redirect
    the user back to the 'search-map' address.
    
    In the case of receiving a GET request, it means that the user has simply
    requested the web page in contrast to the POST request where they have
    entered data that is submitted with a form. As a consequence of not submitting
    any data to the "MapDataForm", what will be displayed is the last "MapDataBase"
    object that was searched for.

    Lastly, this view provides each location searched for with a marker on the
    map. When hovering over the marker, there will be text stating "Click For 
    Description". After clicking on the marker, the name of the city in the 
    native language of the country is revealed to the user.

RETURNS

    If the user has entered an invalid location, the 'invalid_map_location.html'
    HTML template is returned.

    Otherwise, an HttpResponse object will direct the user to the 'search_map.html'
    template located inside the "map_app" application.

        request        --> the HttpRequest object which Django uses to pass
        state through the system.

DESCRIPTION

    This function will accept a web request, and grab all of the "Video"
    objects that are related to the city of Ä°stanbul, by filtering the 
    results to only include the names of specific videos in a Python list.
    The "Video" objects are then assigned to a variable called "videos".

    and finally, the HTML template titled 'istanbul_videos.html' is rendered
    while the dictionary is passed to the template as well.

RETURNS

    Returns an HttpResponse object while directing the user to the 
    'istanbul_videos.html' template located inside the "map_app"
    application. A Python dictionary is returned as well, so that
    it can be accessed inside the HTML template.
